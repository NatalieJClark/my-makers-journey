## Challenge Feedack

#### Command Line & Git Challenge

> #### Feedback from Neil Studd (Makers Coach)
> Hi Natalie, I've reviewed your command line Git challenge from Friday afternoon. First things first, your output (the commits, the files and their contents) was 100% perfect - this already puts you into the upper echelons of people who complete this challenge!

> It was good to see you using techniques to help save you time and avoid typos, including pressing tab to complete file/folder names, and copying/pasting chunks of message text from the curriculum (rather than risk making mistakes by typing them out by hand).

> Your Git usage was also splendid, I was particularly impressed (when doing your first git push) that you remembered there was a much easier way to set the upstream branch than the way that the command line was telling you.

> Your precision for adding multiple files with git add lib/code.rb spec/code_spec.rb was very impressive! It was probably unnecessary in this instance - step 23 specifically said "add everything else", so a simple git add -A (to add all files) would have been enough here. However we often warn people away from using git add -A unnecessarily, as you might end up adding more files than you meant to, so you made a good clean choice here!

> One small note on these submissions - they're not designed to be a test! You're allowed to refer back to your notes at any time; I think you might have been doing this at a couple of points, but I spotted a few points where you said "...I think?" where this should be a prompt to refer back to your notes, rather than guessing. But on every occasion, you thought correctly, so there are no complaints from me here :)
