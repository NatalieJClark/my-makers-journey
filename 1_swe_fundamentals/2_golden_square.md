# MODULE TWO: Golden Square

## Learning Objectives

- [x] Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
- [x] Learn to break programs up into classes.
- [x] Learn to debug your programs.
- [x] Learn to build software as a pair.
- [x] Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.

> #### Feedback from Neil Studd (Makers Coach)
> Hi Natalie, I've reviewed your first Golden Square challenge (test driving a TODO method). I was very impressed with your process and your output; there are a lot of notes below, but only because I know that you will welcome the feedback, not because it's intended to be overly critical!
>
> **The really good stuff:**  
> - Your up-front thought and design process (with a small caveat, below!)
> - The way you tightly followed the TDD loop (also with a small caveat, below!)
> - Implementing a test which required exception handling - and remembering how to do it! It would have been very easy to skip that test as "too hard" or "not important", when it's neither of those things :slightly_smiling_face:
> - Stopping to consider refactoring at the end  
> 
> With that in mind, here are some small areas to watch in the future. Note that I would say the majority of people fall into these same traps!
>
> **1. "Simplest possible code"**  
> When you've got a failing TDD test, the idea is to write the simplest possible code which could make that test pass. There were a couple of places where you skipped slightly too far ahead, though it's completely understandable, because you were going directly to the ultimate solution. EG:
> - At 17min in the video - you implemented the exception handling, when you should have just returned an `Exception` for EVERY input. (Your test would pass, and then your next test would illustrate why that wasn't the optimal solution.)
> - At 22min in the video - you implemented your `return "#TODO" in text` check, when you should just have written `return True` . (Your test would pass, and then your next test would illustrate why that wasn't the optional solution.)
> 
> This is a difficult habit to get into, but it'll prove useful when you're working with larger systems, when "just jumping to the correct code" isn't necessarily quick or easy.
>
> **2. Considering your edge cases**  
> When planning, you wrote down `Assume TODO can appear anywhere in the given string` - but then your tests didn't verify this! You had one which checked `#TODO` at the beginning of the string, but nothing with `#TODO` in the middle or end of the string. Given your chosen implementation, these would have just worked anyway, but it's nice to have the tests there, to protect you in the future. (Somebody might come along with a "better" way to do the check, which might only work if the text is at the beginning of the string - it's good to have the tests as a safety net  
>
> It's good that you had `check_todo("")` (with exception handling) but what about a null value - `check_todo(None)` would currently fail with a different exception.  
>
> Finally (and this is really pedantic and only because I'm a tester) - do you only want to return True if it says `#TODO`? At the moment, for instance, `#TODOS` will return True, as will anybody who writes the word `#TODOMONDO` (because they're a big fan of Romania's 2007 Eurovision entry).  
>
> All of this is to say... when you think you've written all the tests you could possibly need, take a pause and consider whether there might be anything else :slightly_smiling_face:
