# MODULE THREE: Databases

## Learning Objectives

- [x] Design a database schema with at least two tables from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create the schema in a database using SQL.
- [x] Use SQL to query a database to read data from one table or resulting of a join, create new records, update and delete.
- [x] Integrate a relational database to a program by test-driving classes which implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.
- [x] Explain how your program communicates with the database by creating a sequence diagram.

> #### Feedback from Neil Studd (Makers Coach)
> Morning Natalie, I've just reviewed your Python submission from yesterday.
> 
> I've got nothing but praise for you here. There were a couple of moments where I thought you might have slipped up (e.g. having your `__repr__` method returning the string in a format which was different to what it said in the challenge) but you caught these yourself - primarily because you are continuing to follow excellent process.
> 
> **Things I especially liked:**
> - EXCELLENT selection of tests, and using them to follow a strict TDD loop
> - Following what Pytest errors are telling you, especially when it's not necessarily obvious, e.g. when you were getting a list of dictionaries back from the db
> - Predicting what you expected to happen when running pytest, i.e. was it going to pass or fail (and getting it right!)
> - Using autocomplete (in terminal and vscode) to reduce unnecessary typing
> - Taking time to consider refactoring at the end
